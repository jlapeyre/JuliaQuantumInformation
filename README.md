# Quantum-information and -computing related Julia projects

This README is a list of [Julia](https://julialang.org/) projects, packages, and organizations
for quantum information science and technology and related fields,
such as condensed matter physics. It includes links to related lists and other resources.

If you would like to add a project to this list, please feel free to
[make a pull request](https://github.com/jlapeyre/JuliaQuantumInformation).
If you don't have time to make a pull request, please open an issue.

### Notes

* The names of these packages typically end in `.jl`. Sometimes this ending is omitted below.
  In particular, it is included to distinguish packages from
  similarly-named non-Julia packages. TODO: use `.jl` uniformly.
* The date of the most recent development activity appears just after the name of the package.
* Blurbs taken from the sites should be in italics (asterisks in markdown)
* Packages that support quantum information packages (e.g. tensor packages) are included here.
  Exactly where to cut this off is not clear.
* TODO: How to organize ? By organization for some software seems useful. Within orgs: alphabetically?, popularity? ...

 for real tensors. So quantum applications may be limited. Or the author may say "real" for "genuine".
